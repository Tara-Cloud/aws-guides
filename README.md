# Tara's AWS Guides and Walkthroughs

I've had some âœ¨AWS guidesâœ¨ floating around in different places and I decided to create this repository to centralize and keep track of them. I'm still working on a adding a few more so check back soon.

Happy reading and please reach out with any questions, concerns, or corrections ðŸ˜Ž.

| Get Started with the AWS CDK                                       | The AWS CDK is the infrastructure as code love of my life. This is a basic guide for getting started with the CDK and deploying your first application (a static S3 website).                                                  | [Get Started with CDK](./aws-cdk-get-started/README.md)                            |
| Set up AWS IAM Identity Center for your Personal AWS Accounts      | I've used IAM Identity Center at multiple jobs and always wished I could set it up for my personal AWS accounts but assumed it would be complicated. I was wrong, it's very easy to do and I wrote a little guide as I did it. | [Set up IAM Identity Center](./set-up-aws-identity-center/README.md)               |
| Set Up the AWS CLI with Automatic Token Refresh and No Access Keys | With IAM Identity Center in place, I use AWS SSO with automatic token refresh to use the AWS CLI without creating any long term access keys. This guide overviews the set up process.                                          | [Set up IAM Identity Center](./automatic-token-refresh-for-programmatic/README.md) |
